Currently servins as an ORISE Fellow at the USFS Firelab in Missoula, MT. My main focus is on Web GIS products, [StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/68757a7b0cf240ab9b2ac8d371fe12c4), Experience Builders and sharing information with the public. I most recently created an interactive web viewer for data from wildfirerisk.org which should be live in the next month. 

I have lived in Missoula, MT for nine years and enjoy running, biking and floating the river with my dog.
