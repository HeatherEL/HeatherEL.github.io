Currently working as an ORISE Fellow at the USFS Firelab in Missoula, MT. My main focus is on Web GIS products, StoryMaps, Experience Builders and sharing information with the public. I most recently created an interactive web viewer for data from wildfirerisk.org which should be live in the next month. 

I have lived in Missoula, MT for nine years and enjoy running, biking and floating the river with my dog.
